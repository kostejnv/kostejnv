Hey all 👋,

I am a student of MFF UK 🇨🇿🎓🖥️(the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University). I study the 3rd year of Bachelor degree on General Computer Science.

I am interested in theoretical computer science at most, especielly:

+ graph theory
+ combinatorics
+ AI (including deep learning)
+ aproximation and other algorithms

However, I am open to everything new.

I love outdoors activities. Orienteering 🏃, climbing 🧗, slacklining 🌳➖🌳 make me really happy.
