Hey all,
I am a student of MFF UK (the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University). I study the 3rd year of Bachelor degree on General Computer Science.

I am interested in theoretical computer science at most, especielly:

+ graph theory
+ combinatorics
+ AI (including deep learning)
+ aproximation and other algorithms

However, I am open to everything new.

I love outdoors activities. Orienteering, climbing, slacklining make me really happy.

Welcome in my GitHub,
